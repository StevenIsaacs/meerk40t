Issue this at the start of a copilot session in Windows:

PowerShell Environment Reminder: We're working in Windows PowerShell. 
Please use native PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., Remove-Item instead of rm, 
Get-ChildItem instead of ls, Set-Location instead of cd) 
and proper PowerShell syntax. Avoid Unix-style commands unless explicitly needed.
For Python testing, create script files rather than inline execution 
to avoid PowerShell quoting issues. Focus on the Geomstr class for geometric operations, 
and follow the project's plugin architecture with lifecycle hooks. 
Prioritize testing with the existing test suite in the test directory.
