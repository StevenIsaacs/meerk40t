# BalorMK - JCZ Galvo Laser Controller Module

## Overview

BalorMK began life as the meerk40t plugin-driver for Balor by Bryce Schroeder which controls the LMC ezcad2 galvo laser boards. This was eventually rewritten but still uses many of the original names. Even as the backend was rewritten.

The BalorMK module provides comprehensive support for JCZ Technologies galvo laser controllers, including the EZCAD2 series and compatible devices. It implements the complete MeerK40t device driver pattern with device service, driver, and controller components for high-performance galvo laser control.

## Licensing

Balor's original code was GPL licenced but was completely scrapped in pieces over time for this project. The new code still uses the name balor but was recoded from scratch based on various needs. For example the old balor code wasn't well suited to run uncompleted code and send packets while code in another thread is building that data. The replacement uses the name balor but is only based on some of the original research and none of the original code, outside of sections which were written specifically by me (Tatarize) originally anyway.
