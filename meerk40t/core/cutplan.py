"""
CutPlan contains code to process LaserOperations into CutCode objects which are spooled.

CutPlan handles the various complicated algorithms to optimising the sequence of CutObjects to:
*   Sort burns so that travel time is minimised
*   Do burns with multiple passes all at the same time (Merge Passes)
*   Sort burns for all operations at the same time rather than operation by operation
*   Ensure that elements inside closed cut paths are burned before the outside path
*   Group these inner burns so that one component on a sheet is completed before the next one is started
*   Ensure that non-closed paths start from one of the ends and burned in one continuous burn
    rather than being burned in 2 or more separate parts
*   Split raster images in to self-contained areas to avoid sweeping over large empty areas
    including splitting into individual small areas if burn inner first is set and then recombining
    those inside the same curves so that raster burns are fully optimised.

    CutPlan is a centralized class to modify plans during cutplanning. It is typically is used to progress from
    copied operations through the stages to being properly optimized cutcode.

    The stages are:
    1. Copy: This can be `copy-selected` or `copy` to decide which operations are moved initially into the plan.
        a. Copied operations are copied to real. All the reference nodes are replaced with copies of the actual elements
    2. Preprocess: Convert from scene space to device space and add validation operations.
    3. Validate: Run all the validation operations, this could be anything the nodes added during preprocess.
        a. Calls `execute` operation.
    4. Blob: We convert all the operations/elements into proper cutcode. Some operations do not necessarily need to
        convert to cutcode. They merely need to convert to some type of spoolable operation.
    5. Preopt: Preoptimize adds in the relevant optimization operations into the cutcode.
    6. Optimize: This calls the added functions set during the preopt process.
        a. Calls `execute` operation.
