## Elements

The elements modules governs all the interactions with the various nodes, as well as dealing with tree information.
This serves effectively as the datastructure that stores all information about any active project. This includes
several smaller functional pieces like Penbox and Wordlists.

The tree and all data in it are parts of elements.

Most submodules in Elements deal with registering console commands dealing with some particular smaller aspect.
